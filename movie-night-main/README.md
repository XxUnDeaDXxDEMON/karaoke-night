## Concept:

Our goal was to create a space for users to search movies and receive pertinent information about the specific movie they searched. Further, we wanted to enable users to favorite a select list of up to five movies that they can go back to next time they visit our website. By using two movie APIs to fetch information including title, poster, year, ID, and synopsis, Movie Night is a one stop shop for all things movie information.

## Process:

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- APIs
- JSON

Tasks & Roles:

- Overall Idea: The Group
- GitHub Repository Creation: Richard
- HTML & CSS: Jane
- JavaScript APIs: Chao
- JavaScript Local Storage: Jessica
- README: Jessica
- Presentation Slides: Jessica
- Presentation: The Group

Challenges:

- Conceptualizing and streamlining project idea and keeping it within scope of skill set
- Finding API source that worked
  - Data limitation
  - Cost
  - Copyright
- Determining how to divide up the work
- Time difference amongst group members (PST & CST)
- Getting user saved movie IDs to display

Successes:

- Working with a team for the first time
- Working through merge conflicts
- Debugging to get code to work
- Completing the project

## Future Direction

- Work through bugs in the API itself
- Create amd implement a section to display if the selected movie is available to stream and on which specific streaming services it is available (if any)
- Enable user to create a profile/account
- Implement drag/drop function to allow user to place their saved movies in a specific order ranking (1-5)
